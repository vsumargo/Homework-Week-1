# Homework Week 1 - Code Refactor

## Overview

In this project, student modify and existing source code (html and css) to improve and ensure that all acceptance criteria provided are met while still maintaining the same look for the index page. Furthermore, student need to check all the links are functioning properly and all images have alternative text for accessibility reasons.
